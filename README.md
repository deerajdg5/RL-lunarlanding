LunarLander-v2 PPO Agent

This project trains a reinforcement learning agent using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** to solve the **LunarLander-v2** environment from OpenAI Gym.

Features
- PPO algorithm with actor-critic architecture
- Advantage estimation and entropy regularization
- TensorBoard logging
- Reward plotting with matplotlib

Output
TensorBoard logs saved to /runs/
